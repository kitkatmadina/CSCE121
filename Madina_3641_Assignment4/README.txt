Resources: In lab, I used help from the TA and the PT's. I used the textbook. I used the following online resources to help me with syntax, etc. 
http://www.cplusplus.com/
stackoverflow.com
the lecture slides
the textbook

Problems:
For Question 3, I didn't know how to assign the fibonacci values like the psuedocode
had wanted, so the function doesn't run properly. For The first Drill, I put the all
the necessary files in it's own folder (for better organization).
For Question 4, I didn't know how to solve the problem recursively for part b, but
I used swap function so I didn't have to use a vector.
