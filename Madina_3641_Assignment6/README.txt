Problems:
It won't connect to the lobby, and I don't know why.
The code looks right to me, and I can't figure out how to fix this problem.


Description: 
The program simulates a game lobby that can create lobbies and create players,
and start the game. 

I tested by creating 1 lobby and creating players, trying to get the players
to connect to the lobby, printing out the player_state at every function test.
