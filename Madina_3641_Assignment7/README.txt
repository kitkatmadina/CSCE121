Resources: In lab, I used help from the TA and the PT's. I used the textbook. I used the following online resources to help me with syntax, etc.

Problems:
I don't know how to erase Zues from the norse gods and insert him into the greek gods. 

Description: 
Exercise three changes a string from lower case to all uppercase letters while 
exercide for changes a string from upper case to all lower case. It considers a 
character that is inputted via keyboard and determines if the letter is uppercase or lower
case via comparisons. For E3, if it is uppercase it adds 32 ASCII values to make it lowercase,
and for E4, if it is lowercase, it subtracts 32 ASCII values to make it uppercase. 
I got this concept of translating ASCII values from stackoverflow. 

Exercise 11,12,and 14 related to linked lists. 11 and 12 relate to a doubly linked list,
so that class Link has a string member and two pointer members(to the previous link and
the next link). It includes functions to insert a link before, add a link after, erase 
a link, and find a link. 14 relates to a singly linked list with a string member and a single
pointer member to the next link, and includes the same functions. There is also a print_all 
function which can print out the entire list.
