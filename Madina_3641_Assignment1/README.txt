Resources: In lab, I used help from the TA and the PT's. I used the textbook. I used the following online resources to help me with syntax, etc.

Problems:
Initially, my code was having trouble being compiled and executed with Putty but we were able to figure that out. 
For the 2nd problem, I wasn't sure how to code it so that it received inputs for first_name and last_name regardless
of how many PT's there were, so I coded it to take inputs for 1 TA and 2 PTs.
