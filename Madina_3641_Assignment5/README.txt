Resources: In lab, I used help from the TA and the PT's. I used the textbook. I used the following online resources to help me with syntax, etc. 
http://www.cplusplus.com/
stackoverflow.com
syntaxdb.com
rosettacode.org
the lecture slides
the textbook

Problems:
I don't know how to get the random vector to create a vector of different digits. 
I also can't get it to continue once the game ends. 

Cows and Bulls game:
There is a "secret number" vector and a user-input "guess" input, 
and a for loop compares the two vectors. If the digit in the guess is
a digit in the secret number, the cow counter increases. If the digit 
and position of the digit is the same, the bull counter increases, but 
the cow counter does not change. 

Tested for correctness by playing the game, and inputing wrong values
in order to check the exceptions.
